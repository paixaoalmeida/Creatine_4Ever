# Creatine_4Ever
A program to monitor the availability of creatine in a famous website in Brazil, this way you will never miss it, never ever!

# Requirements for using this program.

- Libs: request_html, twilio, os(it comes by default with Python) and Selenium

- U should have a twilio account (we use it to send the messages) and get your credentials

- Once u did this, u will create a "key" fill the key.py file at the same directory with ur credentiais, just like this:

# account_sid = 'UR_ACCOUNT_SID'
# auth_token = 'UR_ACCOUNT_TOKEN'

# twilio_number = 'UR_TWILLIO_NUMBER'
# target_number = 'TARGET_NUMBER'

- This file is gonna be imported into the code and everything is gonna be fine.

Another important stuff is to fill out the file "passwd.py" with all the information it needs:

# growth_email = 'SEU_EMAIL'
# growth_passwd = 'SUA_SENHA'
# seu_cep = 'SEU_CEP'
# cupom_desconto = 'GIGA'

-After this, just check out if u have everything that needed ir order for the program to run,and u are good to go.
