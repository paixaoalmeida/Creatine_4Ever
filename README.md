# Creatine_4Ever
A program to monitor the availability of creatine in a famous website in Brazil, this way you will never miss it, never ever!

# Requirements for using this program.

- U should have a twilio account (we use it to send the messages) and get your credentials

- Once u did this, u will create a "key" fill the key.py file at the same directory with ur credentiais, just like this:

# account_sid = 'UR_ACCOUNT_SID'
# auth_token = 'UR_ACCOUNT_TOKEN'

# twilio_number = 'UR_TWILLIO_NUMBER'
# target_number = 'TARGET_NUMBER'

- This file is gonna be imported into the code and everything is gonna be fine.

- I will try to find a easier way to send the messages, but for now, Twilio is free and a really good service.

*Next Update: make the bot buy stuff and send the receipt with the message*
